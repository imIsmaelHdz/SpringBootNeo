# SpringBootNeo
While I'm investigating more about the graph dataabse paradigm, I would like to create a simplete template so you can run your own project with this main idea by using a Restful API connect with Neo4j.

## RoadMap
SpringBoot Restful API structure :
- Controller
- Model
- Repository -> this is where Neo4J shines!
- Service

More Info will be added to this file about the project.
